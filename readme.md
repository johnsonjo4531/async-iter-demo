# Async Iterators example
Code originated from Dr. Axel Rauschmayer's  repository here: https://github.com/rauschma/async-iter-demo/blob/master/src/lines.js

Basically only added function `onceForAll` and edited `readFile`.

## running

First npm install:
```
npm install
```

Then you can run:

```
npm run start
```

It's not a very good test script as it's not very large so you can fill it with something bigger.
